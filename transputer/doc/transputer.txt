My thinking is that Ultibo could take the place of the Arduino Mega Embed of transputer 
seen at Hackaday.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transputer
The transputer is a series of pioneering microprocessors from the 1980s, featuring 
integrated memory and serial communication links, intended for parallel computing. 
They were designed and produced by Inmos, a semiconductor company based in Bristol, 
United Kingdom.[1] T414 transputer chip
IMSB008 base platform with IMSB419 and IMSB404 modules mounted

For some time in the late 1980s, many[2] considered the transputer to be 
the next great design for the future of computing. While Inmos and the transputer 
did not achieve this expectation, the transputer architecture was highly influential 
in provoking new ideas in computer architecture, several of which have re-emerged 
in different forms in modern systems.

What is a transputer?
It's a processor from the 80's which has some really interesting and different features.

Pascal evolved from Algol 60. Professor Brailsford discusses the rift in the Algol committee that led to its creation.

Raspberry Pi Pico was released in January 2021 with a retail price of $4. 
It was Raspberry Pi's first board based upon a single microcontroller chip; 
the RP2040, which was designed by Raspberry Pi in the UK.

The RP2040 datasheet chapter 3 has the overview of the PIO.
The RP2040 has 2 PIO0 & PIO1
