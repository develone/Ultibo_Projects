This was a simple fix, but took a while to figure out because of less than informative error 
messages. While trying to transfer a file (a Linux kernel) using minicom and ymodem we got 
a protocol failed error when using one machine (my laptop) and it worked on another. After 
checking versions of minicom, serial adapter drivers, ymodem config, etc… we noticed that 
minicom is setup to use /usr/bin/rb and /usr/bin/sb for ymodem comm. Turns out, they 
weren’t installed! On Debian (*buntu) the lrzsz package is what is needed. A quick 
apt-get install lrzsz and we were up and running.

Rb  receives  file(s)  with  YMODEM, accepting either standard 128 byte
       sectors or 1024 byte sectors (YAM sb -k option).  The user  should  de‐
       termine  when  the  1024 byte block length actually improves throughput
       without causing lost data or even system crashes.
       
Sb batch sends one or more files with YMODEM or ZMODEM  protocol.   The
       initial  ZMODEM  initialization is not sent.  When requested by the re‐
       ceiver, sb supports YMODEM-g with "cbreak" tty mode, XON/XOFF flow con‐
       trol, and interrupt character set to CAN (^X).  YMODEM-g (Professional-
       YAM g option) increases throughput over  error  free  channels  (direct
       connection, X.PC, etc.)  by not acknowledging each transmitted sector.
Created a project using the example for Hello World  to test if files could be sent to RPi.
