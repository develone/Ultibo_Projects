For example:
If exp1 Then  
  If exp2 then  
    Stat1  
else  
  stat2;
Despite its appearance, the statement is syntactically equivalent to
If exp1 Then  
   begin  
   If exp2 then  
      Stat1  
   else  
      stat2  
   end;
   
and not to
{ NOT EQUIVALENT }  
If exp1 Then  
   begin  
   If exp2 then  
      Stat1  
   end  
else  
   stat2;

If it is this latter construct which is needed, the begin and end keywords must be present. When in doubt, it is better to add them.
The following is a valid statement:
If Today in [Monday..Friday] then  
  WriteLn (’Must work harder’)  
else  
  WriteLn (’Take a day off.’);
