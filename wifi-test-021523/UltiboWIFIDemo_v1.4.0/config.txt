#
# Default config.txt file for Ultibo on Raspberry Pi 2/3/4
#
# This file should be copied to the SD card along with the required firmware
# files and the appropriate armstub32-rpi?.bin to enable support for secure
# boot and allow access to optional features such as FIQ support on Pi 4
#
# If this file is missing then optional features will be disabled
#
#
# Conditional filter values for config.txt are as follows:
#
# [pi1]		Model A, Model B, Compute Module
# [pi2]		Model 2B (BCM2836- or BCM2837-based)
# [pi3]		Model 3B, Model 3B+, Model 3A+, Compute Module 3
# [pi3+]	Model 3A+, Model 3B+
# [pi4]		Model 4B
# [pi400]	Pi 400
# [cm4]	Compute Module 4
# [pi0]		Zero, Zero W, Zero WH
# [pi0w]	Zero W, Zero WH
