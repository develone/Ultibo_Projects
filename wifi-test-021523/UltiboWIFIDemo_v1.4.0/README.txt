Ultibo Core Demo
----------------

 This is a self running demo image for Ultibo core.
 
 To install the demo simply copy the contents of this zip file to the root directory
 of an SD card with a FAT formatted partition.

 Connect a monitor to the HDMI output of your Raspberry Pi (all models except Pico are
 supported), if you have a network connection available (models B/B+/2B/3B/3B+/4B/400)
 you can connect a network cable which will enable additional features in the demo.
 A USB keyboard can also be connected if available to enable the option to rerun the
 demo when completed.

 Insert the SD card and power on your Raspberry Pi. About 2 or 3 seconds after powering
 on you should see output on the monitor, if you don't, check the SD card is inserted 
 correctly and the power is connected.

 The demo runs for about 3 minutes and explores some of the features available in Ultibo
 core. Once completed you can follow the information on screen to explore more of what
 is available.

 Note that USB support for Raspberry Pi 4B/400 is currently still in development, the
 only way to enable USB on these models is to power the Pi from the 40 pin header and
 connect a USB A to USB C cable to the USB C connector on the board. We hope to have
 full support for the Pi 4 USB shortly.

 Thanks, the Ultibo team.
